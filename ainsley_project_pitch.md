# Ainsley Final Project Pitch

- Who is in your group (or is it a solo project)?

  Since Jemma dropped the class, I will do the project on my own.

- Is your project an analysis or a tool?

  This project will be a tool.

- In a couple of sentences: What problem are you trying to solve, and
  who will it help? (No need to overthink “who will it help” - in the
  case of an analysis project, “It will make my dissertation better” is
  sufficient). 

  I would like to create something that makes analyzing data easier/does
  some analysis for you. I was thinking something that analyzes qPCR or
  ELISA data. This would help anyone in my lab that does these
  experiments.
